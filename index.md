## Hello World ##

  Thanks for checking out my site. It's a work in progress. I'm a past web small time web developer trying to become a modern web dev+. I enjoy learning (even when it's tedious) and I've met a lot of cool people along the way.

  Check out my blog, it's currently the only page I have up. I haven't made any sold decisions on my other pages, including the project page.
