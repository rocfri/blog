## Hello World ##

  Thanks for checking out my site. It's a work in progress. I'm a past web small time web developer trying to become a modern web dev+. I enjoy learning (even when it's tedious) and I've met a lot of cool people along the way.

  I have a handful of changes and updates I want to implement on the site still, but it's coming along.
