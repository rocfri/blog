  <p>This site is being generated by Jekyll and all that comes with it short of SASS. I was very skeptical about Jekyll. It seemed like it’d be just as easy to make a static site the good ol’ fashion way, but I want to try the new and shiny stuff. Now I see how it’s generally more useful than I originally thought. Still I’m not really jumping up and down to use it for a plain old static site, but it does come in handy if you’re looking for something a little less heavy than WordPress or a CMS with a whole database.</p>

<p>The Github flavored variation of MD/Kramdown parser is not playing too well with block elements. Despite what troubleshooting I’ve tried to do, it doesn’t work. I’m pretty sure the conflict is with the CSS I have for my content. It’s easier for me to just write out the HTML by time I figure out how to make it behave.</p>

<p>This process of trying to make things work well together has been kind of a headache. It’s infinitely easier to run Ruby on Windows (this is hard? I mean… there are a few installers for Ruby on Windows these days). Anyway, the latest thing is getting Jekyll to show Google fonts. Then finding out there’s some security issue with the fonts or rather they’re being blocked because I didn’t specify google as a source. Not a problem I’ve had before. From a local standpoint, not sure why CSP would be interfering. Assuming it isn’t, I’m still unable to get Jekyll to render the fonts correctly, so I have to run them the good ol’ fashion way to see if I’m just misspelling or misplacing something.</p>

<p>What do you know? Everything works just fine at the HTML/CSS level.</p>
