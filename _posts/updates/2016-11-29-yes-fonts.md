<h2> Yes, Finally Fonts!</h2>

Today, I hope my project site looks slightly better. Fonts didn't want to render. For a while I wasn't getting any error, then changed my import method and started getting CSP error. Followed the answer here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33984908/google-fonts-violates-content-security-policy"> Thank you much Rolinh</a>.


That took about 5-7 focused hours to figure out, which isn't too long in some respects but too long in a work environment. Making little sites, I've never come across this error before. I read up on CSP and it seems like a pretty good idea to implement from now on. The most frustrating thing, with this and many other little meta tags and tweeks is that support sites don't show the context of the syntax.
