description: Just some notes about changes made to the Projects/Blog page.

I made some improvements to the site. I decided to merge the blog and projects and approach the page a little differently. I have a lot of ideas for site design, but I'm not a particularly talented designer. 

I decided to play around with some formatting on the Projects page. I knew one way to make a grid view page, but not wanting to re-invent the wheel, I found pre-made styles. The template I attempted to use was such a complicated SASS cesspool I couldn't make it work. There was quite a bit more to it than the simple CSS version I end up using. The SASS version seemed needlessly complicated. I hit a bit of a hiccup with the CSS version, but the solution was simple and I 'face-palmed' after realizing what I'd done. 

Anyway, the solution I'd thought of was the old school one where you basically made multiple sidebars. The CSS solution I came across was more elegant using a new column attribute. 

Once again, I don't really understand why the current generation of web devs flock to things like SASS when it seems to muddle the CSS more. CSS is pretty easy in the scheme of things and also really powerful if you put a tiny bit of extra effort into finding what you need in pure CSS.
