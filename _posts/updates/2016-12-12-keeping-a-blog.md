Experimenting with Jekyll and its blogging capabilities has been a useful exercise, but I don't really want to keep a blog.

I've heard and seen mixed opinions on blogging. Some people think it's a good way to track your journey and be useful to others. It makes "you" more relatable. I think that's a bit much to ask of a page that's supposed to showcase something else. I also don't have a whole lot of time to dedicate to blogging.

For the time being, I'm keeping it because I don't have the other content to showcase. I need to put my goals into some kind of backlog; my next goal for this site is just to publish basic contact info and probably merge projects and blogs. The only way to track my progress is through the blog right now. I am considering having a section dedicated to progress, but progress should "show."

I'm planning some updates for the look and feel of the desktop layout. I'm going to condense content into fewer pages.
